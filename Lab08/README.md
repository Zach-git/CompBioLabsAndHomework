## **Lab08**

### This directory contains a script, Lab08.R, that performs the discrete-time logistic growth model as a function. The function takes arguments for:
* intrinsic growth rate
* carrying capacity
* number of generations
* starting abundance

### The functions takes these arguments, performs model calculations, then produces a plot of abundance over generations.
### The script will also save your generation and abundance data in a csv file titled **"GrowthModel.csv"**.
